    "### 7.2.2 Multitask classification\n",
    " You will train one model combined on the three datasets: QQP, SST, and STS, to evaluate\n",
    " multitask learning capabilities. Beyond training, implement an improvement that boosts\n",
    " the model's multitask performance (average performance on all three tasks). Compare the\n",
    " multitask model's performance against models trained on individual tasks to assess the\n",
    " effectiveness of multitask learning. How does training on a different dataset influence the\n",
    " modelâ€™s performance on another task? Make sure to discuss the obtained results. What are\n",
    " the benefits/limitations of this approach? Do you identify any trends?\n",
    " To start, try using the multitask argument already provided, but you may need to modify\n",
    " your training loops.\n",
    " You can systematically investigate how different training (e.g., train on one dataset after\n",
    " another, shuffle all datasets together, and train the model simultaneously, etc) affects its\n",
    " performance on all three tasks. Starting from those insights, you can come up with some\n",
    " ideas of how to improve the multitask performance of the model. Furthermore, you could\n",
    " use some ideas from the papers presented in 7.1. Implement at least one idea that leads to\n",
    " an improvement in the multitask performance"
